# Hot Dog Data  

**Provenance:** This data was collected from self-reporting undergraduate students at the University of Virginia, via a Google Form distributed from the dates 8/29/25 to 9/1/25.    
**Management Plan:** This data and analysis may be used freely, strictly for educational purposes.
**Data Dictionary:**
  - Timestamp: The time, as recorded automatically by the Google Form, that the survey was completed by the participant.
  - Year: The self-reported year of undergraduate education currently being pursued by the survey participant. 
  - 
**Uncertainty:** The survey was distributed within a relatively brief time period, through varying means, by students in two sections of a University of Virginia Data Science class. Thus, potential sources of bias could be:
  - Voluntary response/sampling bias based on the ways in which the survey was distributed (collection methods ranged from posting the survey on one's Instagram, to emailing it to groups surveyors are involved in, to sharing it directly with peers). This likely would have a great effect on the Timestamp variable.
  - A biased sample group (students who are data science students or friends and peers of data science students were more likely to participate). This likely would have an effect on the Year variable, and may also effect other variables. 
**Ethics:** We do not foresee any ethical concerns related to this data or its analysis; data is presented anonymously, and cannot be linked back to participants in any way. Further, the results of this data analysis are likely to be used solely for educational purposes.
